    <p class="experience">What did I learn today?</p>
    <section class="aboutMe">
        <p>I have always used Windows OS as my daily computer up until recently (Nov 16, 2021) I installed Linux on a partition on my windows computer then later decided to put Linux POP OS distro on a SSD I had. </p>
        <p>I have wanted to code for as long as I could remember, I even got a AS degree in CS from Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) then went on to get a Bachelor's in Information Technology and an Masters of Business Administration from the University of Phoenix.  My problem has been that I would give up too easily.  When it got hard I would give up.  I have learned that when it gets hard that's actually when the learning begins. I have to keep pushing, no matter what happens. Not giving up this time, no way, I will not quit on myself.  I will learn to code no matter how long it takes me. I try to make at least 10 git commits daily, some days I exceed that some days I fall short.  The main thing is not how many commits I make it's if I learn something daily.  Little by little it will make a huge impact.
        </p>
        <p>That was a little bit about me, the rest will be the "boring stuff" it will just be what I learned on the daily.</p>

        <p>Daily Commits: 16</p>
        
        <p>I added ohmybash which is a plugin for git so it tells which branch you are on. Super nice and colorful.  Then I worked on my personal projects utahjazz repo where I created a second branch and changed the look of the page and committed those changes.  Also did some work on the practiceGit repo.  Also learning about Linux and how it works.</p>

        <p>Nov 24, 2021</p>
        <p>Daily Commits: 18</p>
        
        <p>This morning I started off by pushing a commit, I forgot I had last night in the practiceGit repo, after I pushed that up I also changed the file path to the utahjazz repo so the correct image shows up, uncommented a block of code from the js file so I could work on resolving the issue.  Fixed a typo in myCodingJourney README.md file, added a footer section as well.  Styled the sections that were made.</p>

        <p>cloned "javascript" repo the main branch was called main created a new branch called it master and it also had other branches called working moved everything over from working to master fixed the typo in the img tag the JS code worked when I rendered the file in the browser.  I merged the working branch to master and verified it was correct with the correct file path.  Then went to GitHub and made the default branch from main to master then deleted the main and the working branches.  After they were deleted made sure the file still worked fine in the browser.</p>

        <p>On the utahjazz repo, I decided to merge the changes from the working branch to the master branch, and then deleted the working branch and the remote working branch.  But it's still a work in progress.</p>

        <p>Nov 25, 2021 (Thanksgiving)</p>
        <p>Daily Commit: 0</p>

        <p>Even though, I had no commits and it was Thanksgiving.  I did do a little bit of learning I learned about Linux from a YouTube video Network Chuck.</p>

        <p>Nov 26, 2021</p>
        <p>Daily Commits: 22</p>

        <p>I started off the day watching some of Network Chuck and learning Linux through YouTube, after that I started working on my "javascript repo" and was trying to add a clear button.  Still trying to figure out why I can't get it to clear the highlight from the page.</p>

        <p>Worked on javascript repo and added a button in the html file to change the background and also working on adding a clear button in app.js the clear button doesn't work yet.</p>

    <p class="experience">What did I learn today?</p>
    <section class="aboutMe">
        <p>I have always used Windows OS as my daily computer up until recently (Nov 16, 2021) I installed Linux on a partition on my windows computer then later decided to put Linux POP OS distro on a SSD I had. </p>
        <p>I have wanted to code for as long as I could remember, I even got a AS degree in CS from Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) then went on to get a Bachelor's in Information Technology and an Masters of Business Administration from the University of Phoenix.  My problem has been that I would give up too easily.  When it got hard I would give up.  I have learned that when it gets hard that's actually when the learning begins. I have to keep pushing, no matter what happens. Not giving up this time, no way, I will not quit on myself.  I will learn to code no matter how long it takes me. I try to make at least 10 git commits daily, some days I exceed that some days I fall short.  The main thing is not how many commits I make it's if I learn something daily.  Little by little it will make a huge impact.
        </p>
        <p>That was a little bit about me, the rest will be the "boring stuff" it will just be what I learned on the daily.</p>

        <p>Daily Commits: 16</p>
        
        <p>I added ohmybash which is a plugin for git so it tells which branch you are on. Super nice and colorful.  Then I worked on my personal projects utahjazz repo where I created a second branch and changed the look of the page and committed those changes.  Also did some work on the practiceGit repo.  Also learning about Linux and how it works.</p>
